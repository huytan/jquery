Nobility, of whom there are several degrees, beginning at
Six-Sided Figures, or <a

and from thence rising in the number of their sides till
they receive the honourable title of <a

or many-Sided. Finally when the number of the sides
becomes so numerous, and the sides themselves so small,
that the figure cannot be distinguished from a <a

is included in the Circular or Priestly order; and this is
the highest class of all.

<p><span class="pull-quote">It is a <span class="drop">Law
of Nature</span> with us that a male child shall have

that each generation shall rise (as a rule) one step in
the scale of development and nobility. Thus the son of a
Square is a Pentagon; the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon;

We'll use the title attribute to invite people to learn more about the linked term at
Wikipedia. In the HTML example, all of the links point to Wikipedia. However, it's
probably a good idea to make the selector expression a little more specific, selecting
only links that contain wikipedia in the href, just in case we decide to add

From the start of this book, we've been using the $() function to access elements in a
document. In a sense, this function lies at the very heart of the jQuery library, as it is
used every time we attach an effect, event, or property to a matched set of elements.
What's more, the $() function has yet another trick within its parenthesesâ€”a
feature so powerful that it can change not only the visual appearance but also the
actual contents of a page. Simply by inserting a snippet of HTML code inside the
parentheses, we can create an entirely new DOM structure from thin air.

By a judicious use of this Law of Nature, the Polygons and
Circles are almost always able to stifle sedition in its
very cradle, taking advantage of the irrepressible and
boundless hopefulness of the human mind.&hellip;
