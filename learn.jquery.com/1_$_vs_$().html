	<h3>$ vs $()</h3>
	<p>Until now, we've been dealing entirely with methods that are called on a jQuery object. For example:</p>

	<xmp>
	$( "h1" ).remove();
	</xmp>
	<p>
	Most jQuery moethods are called on jQuery objects as shown above; these methods are said to be part of the "$.fn" namespace, or the "jQuery prtotype", and are best thought of as jQuery object methods.
	</p>
	<p>However, there are several methods that dot not act on a selection; these methods are said to be part of the jQuery namespace, and are best thought of as core jQuery methods.</p>
	<p>This distinction can be incrediblt confusing to new jQuery users. Here's what you need to remember:
		<ul>
		<li>Methods called on jQuery selections are in the "$.fn" namespace, and automatically receive and return the selection as "this"</li>
		<li>Methods in the "$" namespace are generally utility-type methods, and do not work with selections; they are not automatically passed any arguments, and their return value will vay.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>There are a few cases where object methods and core methods have the same names, such as "$.each()" and ".each". In these cases, be extremely careful when reading the documentation that you are exploring the correct method.</p>
	<p>In this guide, if a method can be called on a jQuery selection, we'll refer to it just by its name: ".each()". If it is a utility method -- that is, a method that isn't called on a selection -- we'll refer to it explicity as a method in the jQuery namespace: "$.each()".</p>
