	<h3>Attributes</h3>
	<p>An element's attributes can contain useful information for your application, so it's important to be able to get and set them</p>

	<h4> The .attr() method</h4>
	<p>The ".attr()" method acts as both a getter and a setter. As a setter ".attr()" can accept either a key and a value, or an object containing one or more key/value pairs.</p>

	".attr()" as a setter:

	<xmp>
	$( "a" ).attr("href", "allMyHrefAreTheSameNow.html");
	$( "a" ).attr({
		title: "all titles are the same too!",
		href: "somethingNew.html"
	});
	</xmp>

	<p>".attr()" as a getter:</p>

	<xmp>
	$( "a" ).attr( "href" ); //returns the href for the first a element in the document
	</xmp>
</body>
