	<h3>How do I get the text value of a selected option?</h3>
	<p>Select elements typically have two values that you want to access. First there's the value to be sent to the server, which is easy:</p>

	<xmp>
	$( "#myselect" ).val();// => 1
	</xmp>

	<p>The second is the text value of the select. For example, using the following select box:</p>

	<xmp>
	<select id="myselect">
	    <option value="1">Mr</option>
	    <option value="2">Mrs</option>
	    <option value="3">Ms</option>
	    <option value="4">Dr</option>
	    <option value="5">Prof</option>
	</select>
	</xmp>

	<p>If you wanted to get the string "Mr" if the first option was selected (instead of just "1") you would do that in the following way:</p>

	<xmp>
	$( "#myselect option:selected" ).text();// => "Mr"
	</xmp>
