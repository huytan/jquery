	<h3>Selecting Elements</h3>
	<p>The most basic concept of jQuery is to "select some elements and do something with them". jQuery supports most CSS3 selectors, as well as some non- standard selectors. For a complete selector reference, visit the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/"> Selectors documentation on api.jquery.com.</a></p>

	<h4>Selecting Elements by ID</h4>

	<xmp>
	$("#myId"); //note IDs must be unique per page.
	</xmp>

	<h4>Selecting elements by Class name</h4>
	<xmp>
	$( ".myClass" );
	</xmp>
	
	<h4>Selecting elements by Attribute</h4>
	<xmp>
	$("input[name='first_name'"); //beware,this can be very slow in older browsers
	</xmp>
	
	<h4>Selecting elements by Compound CSS selector</h4>
	<xmp>
	$("#contents ul.people li");
	</xmp>

	<h4>Pseudo-Selectors</h4>
	<xmp>
	$("a.external:first");
	$("tr:odd");

	//Select all input-like elements in a form (more on this below)
	$("#myForm :input");
	$("div:visible");

	//All  except the first three divs.
	$("div:gt(2)");

	//All currently animated divs
	$( "div:animated")
	</xmp>
	<p><b>Note</b> When using the: "visible" and ":hidden" pseudo-selector, jquery test the actual visibility of the element, not its CSS "visibility" or "display" properties. jQuery looks to see if the element's physical height and width on the page are both greater than zero</p>

	<p>However, this test doesn't work with < tr > elements. In the case of < tr> does check the CSS "display" property, and considers an element hidden if its "display" property is set to "none"</p>

	<p>Elements that have not been added to the DOM will always be considered hidden, even if the CSS that would affect them would render them visible. See the <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/manipulating-elements">Manipulating Elements </a> section to learn how to create and add elements to the DOM.</p>

	<h4>Choosing Selectors</h4>

	<p>Choosing good selectors is one way to improve JavaScript's performance. A little specificity -for example, including an element type when selecting elements by class name- can go a long way. On the other hand, too much specificity can be bad thing. A selector such as "#myTable thead tr th.special" is overkill if a selector such as "#myTable th.special" will get the job done.</p>

	<p>jQuery offers many attribute-based selectors, allowing selections based on the content of arbitrary attributes using simplified regular expressions.</p>

	<xmp>
	// Find all < a > elements whose rel attribute aneds with "thinger"
	 $("a[rel$='thinger']");
	</xmp>
	<p>While these can be useful in a pinch, they can also be extremely slow in older browsers. Wherever possible, make selections using IDs, class name, and tag names.</p>
	<h4>Does my selection contain any elements?</h4>

	<p>Once you've made a selection, you'll often want to know whether you hace anything to work with. A common mistake is to use:</p>

	<xmp>
	//Doesn't work!
	if($("div.foo")){
	...
	}
	</xmp>

	<p>This won't work. When a selection is made using "$()", an object is always returned, and objects always evaluate to "true". Even if the selection doesn't contain any elements, the code inside the "if" statement will still run</p>

	<p>The best way to determine if there are any elements is to test the selection's ".length" property, which tells you how many elements were selected. Ig the answer is 0, the ".length" property will evaluate to "false" when used as a boolean value:</p>
	<xmp>
	//Testing whether a selection contains element
	if($("div.foo").length){
	...
	}
	</xmp>
	<h4>Saving selections</h4>
	<p>jQuery doesn't cache elements for you. If you've made a selection that you might need to make again, you should save the selection in a variable rather than making the selection repeatedly.</p>

	<xmp>
	var divs = $( "div" );
	</xmp>

	<p>Once the selection is stored in a variable, you can call jQuery methods on the variable just like you would have called them on the orginal selection.</p>

	<p>A selection only fetches the elements that are on the page at the time the selection is made. If elements are added to the page later, you'll have to repeat the selection or otherwise add them to the selection stored in the variable. Stored selections don't magically update when the DOM changes.</p>

	<h4>Refining & Filtering Selections</h4>

	<p>Sometimes the selection contains more than what you're after. jQuery offers several methods for refining and fitering selections.</p>

	<xmp>
	// Refining selections.
	$(" div.foo ").has("p"); //div.foo element that contain < p > tags
	$("h1").not(".bar"); // h1 elements that don't have a class of bar
	$("ul li").filter(".current"); // unordered list items with class of current
	$("ul li").first(); // just the first unordered list item
	$("ul li").eq(5); //the sixth
	</xmp>

	<h4>Selecting Form Elements</h4>
	<p>jQuery offers several pseudo-selectors that help find elements in forms. These are especially helpful because it can be difficult to distinguish between form elements based on their state or type using standard CSS selectors.</p>

	<h5>:button</h5>
	<p>Using the :button pseudo-selector targets any < button > elements and elements with a " type="button" "</p>
	<xmp>
	$("form: button");
	</xmp>
	<p>In order to get the best performance using ":button", it's best to first select elements with a standard jQuery selector, then use ".filter( ":button" ). More can be seen on the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/button-selector/"> jQuery :button documentation page</a>. Another option is to precede the pseudo-selector with a tag name or some other selector.</p>

	<h5>:checkbox</h5>
	<p>Using the ":checkbox" pseudo-selector targets any < input > elements with a " type="checkbox" "</p>
	<xmp>
	$( "form :checkbox");
	</xmp>

	<p>Much like the ":button" pseudo-selector, it's best to first select elements with a standard jQuery selector, then to use ".filter(":checkbox" ), or to precede the pseudo-selector with some other selector.</p>

	<h5>:checked</h5>
	<p>Not to be confused with ":checkbox", ":checked" targets checked checkboxes, but keep in mind that this selector works also for "checked" radio buttons, and select elements ( for select elements only, use the :selected selector):</p>
	<xmp>
	$( "form : checked ");
	</xmp>

	<p>The ":checked: pseudo-selector works when used with <b> checkboxes, radio buttons</b> and <b> selects </b> </p>

	<h5>:disabled</h5>

	<p>Using the ":disable" pseudo-selector targets any < input > elements with the disabled attribute:</p>
	<xmp>
	$( "form : disabled");
	</xmp>

	<p>In order to get the best performance using ":disabled", first select elements with a standard jQuery, then use ".filter(":disabled"), or precede the pseudo-selector with a tag name or some other selector</p>

	<h5>:enabled</h5>
	<p>Basically the inverse of the ":disabled" pseudo-selector, the ":enabled" pseudo-selector targets any elements that " do not " have disabled attribute:</p>

	<xmp>
	$("form: enabled");
	</xmp>

	<p>In order to get the best performance using ":enabled", first select elements with a standard jQuery selector, then use ".filter(" :enabled" ), or precede the pseudo-selector with a tag name or some other selector.</p>

	<h5>:file</h5>
	<p>Using the :file pseudo-selector targets any < input > elements that have a "type ="file" "</p>

	<xmp>
	$("form :file");
	</xmp>

	<p>In orther to get the best performance using ":file", first select elements with a standard jQuery selector, then use ".filter(":file"), or precede the pseudo-selector with a tag name or some other selector.</p>

	<p><b>Note:</b> For better performance in modern browsers, use "[type="file"]" instead of the ":file" pseudo-selector</p>

	<h5>:image</h5>
	<p>Using the "image" pseudo-selector targets any < input > elements that have a "type="image""</p>
	<xmp>
	$("form :image");
	</xmp>

	<p>In orther to get the best performance using ":image", first select elements with a standard jQuery selector, then use ".filter(":image"), or precede the pseudo-selector with a tag name or some other selector.</p>

	<p><b>Note:</b> For better performance in modern browsers, use "[type="image"]" instead of the ":image" pseudo-selector</p>

	<h5>:input</h5>

	<p>Using the ":input" selector selects all < input >, < textarea >, < select >, and < button > elements:</p>

	<xmp>
	$("form :input");
	</xmp>

	<h5>:password</h5>

	<p>Using the ":password" pseudo-selector targets any < input > elements with a "type="password".</p>

	<xmp>
	$("form :password");
	</xmp>

	<p>In orther to get the best performance using ":password", first select elements with a standard jQuery selector, then use ".filter(":password"), or precede the pseudo-selector with a tag name or some other selector.</p>

	<p><b>Note:</b> For better performance in modern browsers, use "[type="password"]" instead of the ":password" pseudo-selector</p>

	<h5>:radio</h5>
	<p>Using the ":radio" pseudo-selector targets any < input > elements that have a "type="raido" "</p>
	<xmp>
	$("form :radio");
	</xmp>

	<p>To selector a set of associated radio buttons use:</p>

	<xmp>
	// Selects all radio buttons with the name attribute of gender.
	$(" form input[name='gender']:radio" );
	</xmp>

	<p>In orther to get the best performance using ":radio", first select elements with a standard jQuery selector, then use ".filter(":radio"), or precede the pseudo-selector with a tag name or some other selector.</p>

	<p><b>Note:</b> For better performance in modern browsers, use "[type="radio"]" instead of the ":radio" pseudo-selector</p>

	<h5>:reset</h5>

	<p>Using the ":reset" pseudo-selector targets any < input > elements that have a "type="reset""</p>
	<xmp>
	$("form :reset");
	</xmp>
	<p>In orther to get the best performance using ":reset", first select elements with a standard jQuery selector, then use ".filter(":reset"), or precede the pseudo-selector with a tag name or some other selector.</p>

	<p><b>Note:</b> For better performance in modern browsers, use "[type="reset"]" instead of the ":reset" pseudo-selector</p>

	<h5>:submit</h5>
	<p>Using the ":submit" pseudo-selector targets any < button > or < input > elements with a "type="submit" "</p>

	<xmp>
	$("form :submit");
	</xmp>

	<p>In orther to get the best performance using 	":submit", first select elements with a standard jQuery selector, then use ".filter(":submit"), or precede the pseudo-selector with a tag name or some other selector.</p>

	<p><b>Note:</b> For better performance in modern browsers, use "[type="submit"]" instead of the ":submit" pseudo-selector</p>

	<h5>:text</h5>

	<p>Using the ":text" pseudo-selector targets any < input > elements with a "type="text"" ;</p>

	<xmp>
	$("form :text");
	</xmp>

	<p>In orther to get the best performance using 	":text", first select elements with a standard jQuery selector, then use ".filter(":text"), or precede the pseudo-selector with a tag name or some other selector.</p>

	<p><b>Note:</b> As of jQuery 1.5.2, :text selects < input > elements that have specified "type" attribute. So, "type="text"" is implied</p>
