	<h3>Data Methods</h3>
	<p>There's often data about an element you want to store with the element. In plain JavaScript, you might do this by adding a property to the DOM element, but you'd have to deal with memory leaks in some browsers. jQuery offers a straightforward way to store data related to an element, and it manages the memory issues for you.</p>
	<xmp>
	// Storing and retrieving data related to an element.

	$("#myDiv").data("keyName",{
	foo:"bar"
	});
	$( "#myDiv" ).data( "keyName" ); // Returns { foo: "bar" }
	</xmp>

	<p>Any kind of data can be stored on an element. For the purposes of this article, ".data()" will be used to store references to other elements.</p>

	<p>For example, you may want to establish a relationship between a list item add  a "< div >" that's inside of it. This relationship could be established every single time the list item is touched, but a better solution would be to establish the relationship once, then store a pointer to the "< div >" on the list item using ".data()"</p>

	<xmp>
	//Storing a relationship between elements using .data()

	$("# muList li").each(function(){
		var li =$(this);
		var div = li.find("div.content");

		li.data("contentDiv",div);
	});

	// Later, we don't have to find the div again;
	// we can just read it from the list item's data
	var firstLi = $( "#myList li:first" );
	firstLi.data( "contentDiv" ).html( "new content" );

	</xmp>

	<p>In addition to passing .data() a single key-value pair to store data, you can also pass an object containing one or more pairs.</p>
