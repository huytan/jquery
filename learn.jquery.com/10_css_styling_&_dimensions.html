	<h3>CSS, Styling, & Dimensions</h3>

	<p>jQuery includes a handy way to get and set CSS properties of elements:</p>
	<xmp>
	// Getting CSS properties.
	$( "h1" ).css( "fontSize" ); // Returns a string such as "19px".

	$( "h1" ).css( "font-size" ); // Also works.
	</xmp>

	<xmp>
	// Setting CSS properties.
	$( "h1" ).css( "fontSize", "100px" ); // Setting an individual property.

	// Setting multiple properties.
	$( "h1" ).css({
	    fontSize: "100px",
	    color: "red"
	});
	</xmp>

	<P>Note the style of the argument on the second line- it is an object that contains multiple properties. This is a common way to pass multiple arguments to a function, and many jQuery setter methods accept objects to set multiple values at once.</P>
	<p>Css propetties that normally include a hyphen need to be camelCased in JavaScript. For example. the CSS property "font-size" is expressed as "fontSize" when used as a property name in JavaScript. However, this does not apply when passing the name of a CSS property to the ".css()" method as a string - in that case, either the camelCased or hyphenated form will work.
	</p>
	<p>It's not recommended to use ".css()" as a setter in production-ready code, but when passing in an object to set CSS, CSS properties will be camelCased instead of using a hyphen.</p>

	<h4>Using CSS classes for Styling</h4>

	<p>As a getter, the".css()" method is valuable. However, it should generally be avoided as a setter in production-ready code, because it;s generally best to keep presentational information out of JavaScript code. Instead, wirte CSS rules for classed that describe the various visual states, and then change the class on the element.</p>

	<xmp>
	var h1 =$("h1");
	h1.addClass("big");
	h1.removeClass("big");
	h1.toggleClass("big"); // add if h1 hasn't big class, otherwise remove if h1 has big class
	if(h1.hasClass("big")){
	...
	}
	</xmp>

	<h4>Dimensions</h4>
	<p>jQuery offers a variety of the methods for obtaining and modifying dimension and position information about an element.</p>

	<p>The code below shows a brief overview of the dimensions functionality in jQuery. For complete details about jQuery dimension methods, visit the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/dimensions/">dimensions documentation on api.jquery.com</a>.</p>

	<xmp>
	// Basic dimensions methods.

	// Sets the width of all <h1> elements.
	$( "h1" ).width( "50px" );

	// Gets the width of the first <h1> element.
	$( "h1" ).width();

	// Sets the height of all <h1> elements.
	$( "h1" ).height( "50px" );
	 
	// Gets the height of the first <h1> element.
	$( "h1" ).height();
 
 
	// Returns an object containing position information for
	// the first <h1> relative to its "offset (positioned) parent".
	$( "h1" ).position();
	</xmp>
